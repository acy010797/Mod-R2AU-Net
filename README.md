# Mod-R2AU-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation
Mod-R2AU-Net is a powerful and optimized variant of the U-Net architecture, specifically designed for advanced medical image segmentation tasks, particularly brain tumor segmentation on MRI images. The model introduces Recurrent Residual Convolutional Layers (R2CL) and Attention Gates (AGs) to improve feature extraction and focus on the most critical regions within an image, resulting in precise and accurate segmentation.

By incorporating R2CL blocks in both the encoder and decoder paths, Mod-R2AU-Net enhances feature representation through iterative residual learning, capturing complex patterns in MRI images. The attention mechanisms further refine the segmentation process by concentrating on the most relevant areas of the image, significantly improving the model’s ability to differentiate between healthy tissue and tumor regions.

Despite the model’s advanced architecture, Mod-R2AU-Net remains computationally efficient, reducing the number of parameters and computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. With a reduced complexity of 212 GFlops and 21.3M parameters, this lightweight model is well-suited for real-world clinical applications, enabling faster processing times and more resource-friendly deployment on modern hardware.

Mod-R2AU-Net strikes an excellent balance between computational efficiency and segmentation precision, making it a powerful tool for medical professionals and researchers working with large-scale MRI datasets.
